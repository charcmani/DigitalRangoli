# DigitalRangoli
This project is built on Python 2.7 and is 3 compatible. It uses the Python's Turtle module to draw patterns similar to a classic Indian 
Festival rangoli which consist of bright color. 
This Digital Rangoli is made on Adhoc basis resulting to a longer source code but is quite simple to understand.
Suggetions are always welcomed.
Thanks
